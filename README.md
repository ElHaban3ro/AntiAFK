# ANTIAFK
AntiAFK is a bot for Windows, Linux and Mac (using Python) that allows you to bypass inactivity limitations in different video games (listed below).

If you know some programming and need to tinker a bit with the macros briefly review the file [antiafk.py](https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/AntiAFK/blob/main/antiafk.py).
  
  

# Instalaci√≥n

1. First clone the repository using git.

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/AntiAFK
	```    

2. Now install the necessary Python dependencies for the app to work properly.

	```bash	
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. Now run the script [antiafk.py](https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/AntiAFK/blob/main/antiafk.py) with python and provide the indicated parameters:

	```bash
	py antiafk.py [Videogame] [Reports | Boolean values] [Tick Time | Use a numerical value that is represented in SECONDS]
	```

	A example:
	```bash
	py antiafk.py Minecraft true 300
	```

 
4. Now you have it ready! Using the game in window mode press "0" to start the bot and the same key to stop it. You will receive status information on the console.
